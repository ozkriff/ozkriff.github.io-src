ZoC is dead. Long life Zemeroth.

Soo, yeah, `Zone of Control <https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc>`_ project
is officially discontinued.
Sorry, friends.

^ "ZoC's is dead, baby. ZoC is dead."

------

Why am I killing it?
I've overestimated my resources/skills and got totally overwhelmed by the scope:

- I can't see the finish line and had no idea what exactly I can feature-cut.

  Strategic mode? Sane UI? Networking? Skeletal animations? Particles?
  
  Oh-oh, I don't beleive that ZoC could be cool without any of these (and many more) features.

  Lost the hope to ever finish the game and a motivation to continue.

- Slot system is a strange beast (TODO: explain what is it)

  follow up on slots system: no idea how to make some friendly user intarface.
  yes, two panels is ugly. context menu is ugly too.

  It created some problems with visual scale:
  unit models are too small and there’re too much of everything on the screen.
  It's especially bad on the android as the screen is small.

- `Maybe I should make an FPS? No, that's stupid. <http://i.imgur.com/F6qf4FNl.png>`_

Ahem, Another reason is that my views on what's is important for strategic games
have changed in the last several years (опиши)

Smaller games, singleplayer, less content, stupid AI - это же все уменьшает масштаб проекта.

...And that it.

Goodbye, my old friend Zone of Control.

I’d spent a few months in the end of the spring (TODO concrete months)
thinking about do i still want to make rusty games and what’s important.

Beautiful article:
http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game

    Rule 14: "14. IF YOU DO QUIT, SCALE DOWN, NOT UP"

    Okay, sometimes it is time to call it quits.
    Maybe there’s just no way you’ll ever finish, and what you have is too big a mess to cut anything out.
    Maybe the rest of your team has quit already.
    My hope in writing this list is to help people avoid this possibility,
    but hey, maybe you’re just coming off of such a project.
    And sometimes... shit just happens.

    If there’s no salvaging it, at least make sure that you scale down your next project.
    It’s easy to set your sights higher and higher, even as your projects become less and less finished.
    “My SKILLS are improving! I’m learning from my failure,” is a common excuse.
    But I think this is why it’s important to treat finishing as a skill, too.

What are the main points?
What are the differences from ZoC?

TODO: не надо так подробно тут, только общее видение в паре предложений.

- simple vector 2d graphics with just 2-5 sprites per unit

  The style was born from `my old experiments with 2d ZoC <http://i.imgur.com/NNQkC1e.png>`_.

- single player only, intentionally stupid and predictable AI

- short game session (under an hour)

- reaction attacks and action’s interruption

  spearman can control a big territory but can’t really be an attacking force

- high dynamic and a lot of movement

  most of the commands must result in unit movement as a side effect

  jump & slash

  throw around fighters after big blows

  dodged the strike - fall back on tile, attacker will move to your old position.

(TODO: add links to projects)

Something in between of the Banner Saga, Hoplite, Auro and AoD

------

So, yeah, I'm starting over _again_. What will be different this time?

(TODO: или не надо это расписывать?)

---------------------------------

Ok, that was just the plan. What's actually done already?

Here's the repo: https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth

Right now it looks like this:

Recent "gameplay" video:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="youtube"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVt_UOnmdKI" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>


Only two type of units for now - basic infantry.

Units have a few hitpoints.

Every unit has two active attack points and one reactive AP.

Reaction attacks, movement interruptions - the cornerstone of the game.

Basic AI - move closer and attack.

basic UI with text/image buttons and panels.

Works on android:

^ android support from the begining of the development (наследство зока)

Häte2d - custom 2d engine. yeah, i’m fool who don’t learn anything :(


Totally ignored rule 3 from hot-to-finish-a-game article:

    3. DON’T ROLL YOUR OWN TECH IF YOU DON’T HAVE TO

In the begining of hate I didn't know that ggez is mature.

(Name and umlauts is a reference to Love2d framework. just in case)

reuse of ZoC’s codebase - not from scratch

------

Architecture is mostly taken from ZoC (minus networking and multiple game states):

Scene action system - based on cocos’s one and something I did
in dead ZoC’s devbranch:

Btw, here's Imgur devlog - http://imgur.com/a/SMVqO - that I'm trying to keep updated.
