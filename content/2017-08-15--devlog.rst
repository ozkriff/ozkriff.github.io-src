ZoC is dead. Long life Zemeroth.
################################

:tags: devlog, zoc, zemeroth


sorry for the big pos (TODO: I can’t split this into two parts, right?)
I should have written about ZoC’s death a month ago or so, but at that
time I wasn’t sure about zemeroth.
And zemeroth is partly implemented, so it seems strange not to tell about it.

TODO: link to the tweet

I’ll try not to bloat the text without need but be ready to scroll a lot
(mostly because of images :-D)



ZoC's is dead, baby. ZoC is dead.

Soo, yeah, `Zone of Control <https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc>`_ project
is officially discontinued.
Sorry, friends.

Why?

- I had overestimated my skills + my views on what's is
  important for strategic games have changed

- I’ve greeeeatly overestimated my resources/abilities
  lost the hope to ever finish the game
  lost motivation to continue


- visual scale problems - unit models are too small and there’re too much of
  everything on the screen. this problem’s especially bad on the android phone’s


- three-slot system is a strange beast (TODO: explain what is it)

- I had no idea what exactly I can feature-cut.


- follow up on slots system: no idea how to make some friendly user intarface.
  yes, two panels is ugly. context menu is ugly too.

- strategic mode? oh oh

I’d spent a few months in the end of the  sprint (TODO concrete months)
thinking about do i still want to make rusty games and what’s important.

Beautiful artiacle:

Totally ignored rule 3 (TODO: движок описан позже, так что перенеси куда-то вниз)

    Rule 14: "14. IF YOU DO QUIT, SCALE DOWN, NOT UP"

What are the main points?

- android support from the begining of the development

What are the differences from ZoC?

- simple vector 2d graphics with just 2-5 sprites per unit

  The style was born from my old experiments with 2d ZoC:

    :alt: old experiments with 2d ZoC

- single player only, intentionally stupid and predictable AI

- short game session (under an hour)

- reaction attacks and action’s interruption

  spearman can control a big territory but can’t really be an attacking force

- high dynamic and a lot of movement

  most of the commands must result in unit movement as a side effect

  jump & slash

  throw around fighters after big blows

  dodged the strike - fall back on tile, attacker will move to your old position.

Something in between of the Banner Saga, Hoplite, Auro and AoD

TODO: umlaut, love2d, ggez

reuse of ZoC’s codebase - not from scratch

^ scene action system - based on cocos’s one and something I did
in dead ZoC’s devbranch.

btw, piston has something similar.

------

only two type of units for now
reaction attacks, movement interruptions, hitpoints, AI

basic UI with panels
