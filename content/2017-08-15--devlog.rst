ZoC is dead. Long life Zemeroth.

Soo, yeah, `Zone of Control <https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc>`_ project
is officially discontinued.
Sorry, friends.

^ "ZoC's is dead, baby. ZoC is dead."

Why am I killing ZoC?
I've overestimated my resources/skills and got totally overwhelmed by the scope:

- I can't see the finish line and had no idea what exactly I can feature-cut.

  Strategic mode? Sane UI? Networking? Skeletal animations? Particles? oh-oh

  Lost the hope to ever finish the game and a motivation to continue.

- Slot system is a strange beast (TODO: explain what is it)

  follow up on slots system: no idea how to make some friendly user intarface.
  yes, two panels is ugly. context menu is ugly too.

  It created some problems with visual scale:
  unit models are too small and there’re too much of everything on the screen.
  It's especially bad on the android as the screen is small.

------

Another reason is that my views on what's is important for strategic games
have changed in the last several years (опиши)

...And that it. Goodbye, my old friend Zone of Control.

^ initial Zemeroth's svg mockup

I’d spent a few months in the end of the  sprint (TODO concrete months)
thinking about do i still want to make rusty games and what’s important.

Beautiful article:

Totally ignored rule 3 (TODO: движок описан позже, так что перенеси куда-то вниз)

    Rule 14: "14. IF YOU DO QUIT, SCALE DOWN, NOT UP"

What are the main points?

What are the differences from ZoC?

- simple vector 2d graphics with just 2-5 sprites per unit

  The style was born from my old experiments with 2d ZoC:

    :alt: old experiments with 2d ZoC

- single player only, intentionally stupid and predictable AI

- short game session (under an hour)

- reaction attacks and action’s interruption

  spearman can control a big territory but can’t really be an attacking force

- high dynamic and a lot of movement

  most of the commands must result in unit movement as a side effect

  jump & slash

  throw around fighters after big blows

  dodged the strike - fall back on tile, attacker will move to your old position.

Something in between of the Banner Saga, Hoplite, Auro and AoD

Ok, that was just the plan. What's actually done already?

^ android support from the begining of the development (наследство зока)

Häte2d - custom 2d engine. yeah, i’m fool who don’t learn anything :(

In the begining of hate I didn't know that ggez is mature.

TODO: umlaut, love2d, ggez

(Name and umlauts is a reference to Love2d framework. just in case)

reuse of ZoC’s codebase - not from scratch

^ scene action system - based on cocos’s one and something I did
in dead ZoC’s devbranch.

(`btw, piston has something similar <https://docs.rs/piston2d-sprite/0.36.0/sprite/enum.Animation.html>`_)

------

only two type of units for now
reaction attacks, movement interruptions, hitpoints, AI

basic UI with text/image buttons and panels.

Btw, here's Imgur devlog - http://imgur.com/a/SMVqO - that I'm trying to keep updated.
