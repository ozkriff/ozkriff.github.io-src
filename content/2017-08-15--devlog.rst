ZoC is dead. Long life Zemeroth.

Soo, yeah, `Zone of Control <https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc>`_ project
is officially discontinued.
Sorry, friends.

^ "ZoC's is dead, baby. ZoC is dead."

------

Why am I killing it?
I've overestimated my resources/skills and got totally overwhelmed by the scope:

- I can't see the finish line and had no idea what exactly I can feature-cut.

  Strategic mode? Sane UI? Networking? Skeletal animations? Particles?
  
  Oh-oh, I don't beleive that ZoC could be cool without any of these (and many more) features.

  Lost the hope to ever finish the game and a motivation to continue.

- Slot system is a strange beast (TODO: explain what is it)

  follow up on slots system: no idea how to make some friendly user intarface.
  yes, two panels is ugly. context menu is ugly too.

  It created some problems with visual scale:
  unit models are too small and there’re too much of everything on the screen.
  It's especially bad on the android as the screen is small.

------

Another reason is that my views on what's is important for strategic games
have changed in the last several years (опиши)

Smaller games, singleplayer, less content, stupid AI - это же все уменьшает масштаб проекта.

...And that it.

Goodbye, my old friend Zone of Control.


Zemeroth
--------

I’d spent a few months in the end of the  sprint (TODO concrete months)
thinking about do i still want to make rusty games and what’s important.

Beautiful article:

Totally ignored rule 3 (TODO: движок описан позже, так что перенеси куда-то вниз)

    Rule 14: "14. IF YOU DO QUIT, SCALE DOWN, NOT UP"

Initial Zemeroth's svg mockup:

What are the main points?
What are the differences from ZoC?

TODO: не надо так подробно тут, только общее видение в паре предложений.

- simple vector 2d graphics with just 2-5 sprites per unit

  The style was born from `my old experiments with 2d ZoC <http://i.imgur.com/NNQkC1e.png>`_.

- single player only, intentionally stupid and predictable AI

- short game session (under an hour)

- reaction attacks and action’s interruption

  spearman can control a big territory but can’t really be an attacking force

- high dynamic and a lot of movement

  most of the commands must result in unit movement as a side effect

  jump & slash

  throw around fighters after big blows

  dodged the strike - fall back on tile, attacker will move to your old position.

TODO: add links to projects

Something in between of the Banner Saga, Hoplite, Auro and AoD

---------------------------------

Ok, that was just the plan. What's actually done already?

Here's the repo: https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth

^ android support from the begining of the development (наследство зока)

------

Häte2d - custom 2d engine. yeah, i’m fool who don’t learn anything :(

In the begining of hate I didn't know that ggez is mature.

TODO: umlaut, love2d, ggez

(Name and umlauts is a reference to Love2d framework. just in case)

reuse of ZoC’s codebase - not from scratch

^ scene action system - based on cocos’s one and something I did
in dead ZoC’s devbranch.

(`btw, piston has something similar <https://docs.rs/piston2d-sprite/0.36.0/sprite/enum.Animation.html>`_)

------

Only two type of units for now
reaction attacks, movement interruptions, hitpoints, AI

basic UI with text/image buttons and panels.

Btw, here's Imgur devlog - http://imgur.com/a/SMVqO - that I'm trying to keep updated.
