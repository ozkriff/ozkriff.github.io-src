ZoC is dead. Long life Zemeroth.

:tags: devlog, zoc, zemeroth


Soo, yeah, `Zone of Control <https://github.com/ozkriff/zoc>`_ project
is officially discontinued.
Sorry, friends.

^ "ZoC's is dead, baby. ZoC is dead."


Why have I killed it?
I've overestimated my resources/skills and got totally overwhelmed by the scope:

- I can't see the finish line and had no idea what exactly I can feature-cut.
  Strategic mode? Sane UI? Networking? Skeletal animations? Particles?
  Oh-oh, I don't believe that ZoC could be cool without any of these (and some others) features.

  This situation totally drained all my motivation to continue the project.

- Slot system is a strange beast (TODO: explain what is it)

  No idea how to make some friendly user interface.
  Two panels (for friends and enemies) solution is ugly.
  Context menu is ugly too.

  Slots created some problems with visual scale:
  infantry models are just too small, especially on phone’s screen.

- `Maybe I should make an FPS? No, that's stupid. <http://i.imgur.com/F6qf4FNl.png>`_
  Ahem, just joking.

Another reason is that my views on what's is important for strategic games
have changed in the last several years.
Now I prefer `smaller <http://keithburgun.net/videogames-are-broken-toys>`_
`single-player <http://keithburgun.net/the-default-number-of-players-is-one>`_
games
`with strong accent on emergent complexity <http://keithburgun.net/minimalism-vs-elegance>`_.

...And that it.

Goodbye, my old friend Zone of Control.

There’s one great article:

http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game

I have re-read it a dozen times in the last few years.
In the context of ZoC’s fail the most important part of that article is:

    Rule 14: IF YOU DO QUIT, SCALE DOWN, NOT UP

    Okay, sometimes it is time to call it quits.
    Maybe there’s just no way you’ll ever finish, and what you have is too big a mess to cut anything out.
    Maybe the rest of your team has quit already.
    My hope in writing this list is to help people avoid this possibility,
    but hey, maybe you’re just coming off of such a project.
    And sometimes... shit just happens.

    If there’s no salvaging it, at least make sure that you scale down your next project.
    It’s easy to set your sights higher and higher, even as your projects become less and less finished.
    “My SKILLS are improving! I’m learning from my failure,” is a common excuse.
    But I think this is why it’s important to treat finishing as a skill, too.

Sounds reasonable to me.
So I need a new much less ambitious project
which still shares some of the ZoC’s core values.

I’ve spent May and June
(in the heavy existential crisis)
resting and thinking about do i still want to make rusty games and what’s important.

^ TODO: думая о том, что именно делать дальше.



- Single player only;
- 3-6 fighters under player’s control;
- Intentionally stupid and predictable AI;
- Short game session (under an hour) and small maps without scrolling;
- Simple vector 2d graphics with just 2-5 sprites per unit.
  Something like `my old experiments with 2d ZoC <http://i.imgur.com/NNQkC1e.png>`_;
- Reaction attacks and action’s interruption;
- Highly dynamic (lots of small unit moves as a side effect of other events);

Something in between of
`Banner Saga <http://store.steampowered.com/app/237990/The_Banner_Saga>`_,
`Hoplite <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite>`_,
`Auro <http://store.steampowered.com/app/459680/Auro_A_MonsterBumping_Adventure/>`_
and
`Age of Decadence <http://store.steampowered.com/app/230070/The_Age_of_Decadence/>`_.

So, yeah, I'm starting over _again_. What will be different this time?

(TODO: или не надо это расписывать?)

---------------------------------

Ok, that was just the plan. What's actually done already?

Here's the repo: https://github.com/ozkriff/zemeroth

Right now it looks like this:

Recent "gameplay" video:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="youtube"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVt_UOnmdKI" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>


Only two type of units for now - basic infantry.

Units have a few hit points.

Every unit has two active attack points and one reactive AP.

Reaction attacks, movement interruptions - the cornerstone of the game.

Basic AI - move closer and attack.

basic UI with text/image buttons and panels.

Works on android:

I’m a fool who don’t learn anything and
totally ignored rule 3 from hot-to-finish-a-game article:

    3. DON’T ROLL YOUR OWN TECH IF YOU DON’T HAVE TO

Say hello to yet another Rust 2d engine: Häte2d :-D (TODO: ссылкку поставь)

It’s not intended for general use by anyone.
It doesn’t even have keyboard input yet.
Maybe, later.

In the beginning of hate I didn't know that ggez is mature.

(Name and umlauts is a reference to Love2d framework. just in case)

reuse of ZoC’s codebase - not from scratch

Architecture is mostly taken from ZoC (minus networking and multiple game states):

Scene action system - based on cocos’s one and something I did
in dead ZoC’s dev branch:

Btw, here's Imgur devlog - http://imgur.com/a/SMVqO - that I'm trying to keep updated.
